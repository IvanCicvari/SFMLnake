# SFMLnake
Snake clone using SFML library (**`WIP`**)

This project is made purely for learning purposes. Because I'm doing it in my free time and when I'm motivated enough.. it may take a while :-).

My **ToDo** checklist - thinks I want to include as:

### Part of learning process
- [x] create simple game engine;	
- [x] create resources manager (handle "heavy" objects such as textures);		
- [x] implement Game Loop pattern;	
- [x] implement State pattern;		
- [] implement Observer pattern (achievements because... why not);	
- [] learn cmake;	
- [] apply open sonar;	
- [] ...clean loots of issues that sonar detects;	
- [] be proud of what I created :-)	

### Game itself
- [x] Intro state		
- [x] Main menu state		
- [x] Main game state - field		
- [x] Main game state - snake		
- [] Main game state - loose condition		
- [] Main game state - win condition		
- [] Trophies state - achievements
