# SFMLnake
Snake clone using SFML library (**`WIP`**)

This project is made purely for learning purposes. 
Because I'm doing it in my free time and when I'm motivated enough.. it may take a while :-).

My **ToDo** checklist - thinks I want to learns:

#### Part of learning process
- [X] learn cmake (basics)
- [] apply open sonar;	
- [] apply travis;	
- [] be proud of what I created :-)		.

#### Graphics:
