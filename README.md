# SFMLnake

Snake clone using SFML library (**`WIP`**)

This project is made purely for learning purposes. Because I'm doing it in my free time and when I'm motivated enough.. it may take a while :-).

My **ToDo** checklist - thinks I want to include as:

### Part of learning process
[x] create simple game engine;
[x] create resources manager (handle "heavy" objects such as textures);
[x] implement Game Loop pattern;
[x] implement State pattern;
[] implement Command pattern (if it's not an overkill);
[] implement Observer pattern (achievements because.. why not);
[] apply open sonar;
[] ...clean loots of issues that sonar detects;
[] be proud of what I created :-)

### Game itself
[x] Intro state
[] Main menu state
[] Main game state - field
[] Main game state - snake
[] Main game state - loose condition
[] Main game state - win condition
[] Trophies state - achievements
